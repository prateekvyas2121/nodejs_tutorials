//first we'll require the lodash package
 const _ = require('lodash');
 //and now from here let's acctuallyt use it ...to prove that it's working..

let example =  _.fill([1,2,3,4,5]/*array*/,"banana"/*a value with what you wanna replace these values in array with*/,1/*start index*/,4/*end index*/);

console.log(example);
